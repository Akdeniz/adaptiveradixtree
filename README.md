# adaptiveradixtree

Adaptive Radix Tree implemenation to store character sequences along with their indexes efficiently. It is analogous to `std::map<std::string, std::vector<int>>` but more memory efficient with natural data.

This implemenation is based on this paper : https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/ART.pdf

## TODO
- add memory and performance comparisons.
